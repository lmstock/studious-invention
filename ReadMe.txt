=====> TO DO:

	integrate die rolls js - is there a better way?
	
	more ads
		Cherry ad slots

	csv game content
		how will we dynamically add rows?
		achievements
		modifiers


RESEARCH:

	local storage
	
ADS IDEAS:

	ADD 8bit ads? - 
	wigabits, ads for lots, ecma, airadio
	quick tiger drawings to start. imgs
	kennedy miles

	"for a better morning"	
	"PRO"
	"HOT"
	"You're Worth X"
	"X is forever"
	"Save X"
	"Every Little Bit"
	"Advancement"
	"Through Technology"
	"We are There"
	"Accelerate Yesterday"

CSS: 
	  mobile
	  tigers bots

FUTURE:

	rare find! (Pinball surprisement!)
	Sub assembly surprise!
	Catalog
	Teeth - Shady Fellow
	
	Random breakage.
	psychic paper (esp badge) - get into lots free or early
	integrate local weather?
